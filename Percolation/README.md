In this project, we model a composite system of ```n * n``` sites. Each site can be either open (white) or closed (black). A site is _full_ (blue) if it is connected to a open site at the top through neighboring open sites. The system **percolates** when a bottom open site is connected to a top open site. This can be used to model metallic connectivity or if underground oil would percolate to the surface. Go to ["Percolation" assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) for a complete description of the assignment.
